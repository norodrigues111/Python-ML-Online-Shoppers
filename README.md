 CCT College Dublin Continuous Assessment | Assignment Title: HDip_Strategic_Thinking_Semester2

Assessment Task: 
This assessment aims to evaluate the group's ability to apply project management methodology to evaluate and enhance the capstone project developed in semester one. The group should be able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the capstone project from semester one and make improvements based on additional knowledge. Additionally, machine learning results should improve based on understanding the dataset, which machine learning models are best used, and why. Improving the model’s performance with hyper-tuning parameters with an understanding of the performance metrics and dataset. Finally, validate the results and report on your findings. 
The final report should build on from semester one and include your findings of machine learning implementation, results validation, model comparison, and any future recommendations. The report should be presented in a clear and concise manner, and it should demonstrate the group's ability to work collaboratively using a project management methodology.
The presentation should present your findings in a clear way for stakeholders.

You are now required to present your findings and initial results with the aid of 4 elements: a presentation, report paper, artefact, and individual reflective report.

You will create a maximum 5-minute presentation where you will include the following items. Remember that this is a guideline. You can include other items not mentioned below or remove items irrelevant to your project as long as you are within the allocated 5 minutes. 

o	Introduction.
o	Business description.
	Hypothesis.
	General goal.
	Success criteria/indicators.
o	Technologies used.
	Models
	Libraries
	Machine Learning Algorithm (at least 3 used and compared is required).
	Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation (required).
	etc...
o	What has been accomplished so far?
	Data: datasets, source, attributes, dimensions, descriptive statistics, data visualisation, data preparation (required).
	Models.
o	Challenges encountered.
	Including strategies used to overcome them.
o	Results and analysis… next steps.
o	Conclusion.


Further details of the assessment: A GitHub repo must be created, and the Jupyter Notebook and report Word document must be put into a GitHub repo for collaboration and version control. The lecturer will be added to the repo as a collaborator. GitHub branches can be created so that the lecturer can view individual contributions. GitHub's activity tracking ensures transparency in contributions. There should be at least 10 to 15 commits throughout the semester.
